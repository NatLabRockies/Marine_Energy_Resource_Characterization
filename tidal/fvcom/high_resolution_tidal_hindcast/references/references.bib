abstract = {We provide an assessment of the tidal stream energy resource of the Aleutian Islands, Alaska via a validated barotropic tidal numerical model of the region. Eight island passes are identified as energy “hotspots”. The annual mean kinetic energy fluxes, KEF, calculated at each pass vary from 1000 to 11,000 MW, while the annual available energy, AAE, varies from 5 to 42 MWh m−2. Notable seasonal modulation to monthly power density averages and ranges are noted at some passes and not others. Seasonal adjustment is linked to the semi-annual solar declination cycle which enhances (dampens) diurnal (D1) tidal amplitudes in summer/winter (spring/fall) as well as the time-varying phase lag between D1 and semidiurnal (D2) fortnightly tidal cycles. Annual variability in monthly mean power density scales with the tidal current form factor, Fu, with the largest seasonal change occurring for Fu>1 (D1 dominated tide). The spread in power density over a month is on average smaller for passes with mixed tides (Fu=1) than those with D1 or D2 dominance, as changes to fortnightly phase lag become influential to net power density ranges when tides are mixed. This study outlines overlooked, but relevant, long-term modulation to tidal streams in regions with mixed tides.}

title = "Modeling Assessment of Tidal Energy Extraction in the Western Passage",
abstract = "Numerical models have been widely used for the resource characterization and assessment of tidal instream energy. The accurate assessment of tidal stream energy resources at a feasibility or project-design scale requires detailed hydrodynamic model simulations or high-quality field measurements. This study applied a three-dimensional finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) to simulate the tidal hydrodynamics in the Passamaquoddy-Cobscook Bay archipelago, with a focus on the Western Passage, to assist tidal energy resource assessment. IEC Technical specifications were considered in the model configurations and simulations. The model was calibrated and validated with field measurements. Energy fluxes and power densities along selected cross sections were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the tidal energy development at several hotspots that feature strong currents. When taking both the high current speed and water depth into account, the model results showed that theWestern Passage has great potential for the deployment of tidal energy farms. The maximum extractable power in the Western Passage was estimated using the Garrett and Cummins method. Different criteria and methods recommended by the IEC for resource characterization were evaluated and discussed using a sensitivity analysis of energy extraction for a hypothetical tidal turbine farm in theWestern Passage.",
