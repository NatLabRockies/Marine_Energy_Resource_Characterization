# Description


The WPTO High Resolution Tidal Hindcast dataset provides standardized tidal energy data for
five strategically selected U.S. coastal locations with significant tidal energy potential.
Developed collaboratively by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL), this dataset is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power
Technologies Office Marine Energy Resource Assessment and Characterization project.

Generated using FVCOM 4.3.1 (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) [@fvcom], the dataset contains one year of
high-resolution tidal energy data including eastward and northward sea water velocities, surface
elevation, calculated speed, flow direction, and power density across 10 uniform sigma layers. The
data follows [CF-1.10][cf_conventions], [ACDD-1.3][acdd_conventions], and [ME Data Pipeline-1.0][me_data_pipeline] conventions and meets IEC 62600-201 [@iec_62600_201] Stage 1
tidal resource analysis standards.

The five locations include Aleutian Islands and Cook Inlet (Alaska), Piscataqua River (New
Hampshire), Puget Sound (Washington), and Western Passage (Maine), with temporal resolutions ranging
from half-hourly to hourly and spanning complete annual cycles for each dataset. This standardized
dataset supports theoretical and technical resource potential assessments, commercial development
planning, policy analysis, environmental planning, and research applications for the marine energy
community.

- Depth and Surface Elevation calculated to NAVD88 [meters]
- Calculated sea water speed [meters per second]
- Calculated sea water to direction [degrees clockwise from true north]
- Calculated sea water power density [watts per square meter]
- Calculated surface elevation relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL) [meters]
- Calculated total depth and layer depths relative to MSL [meters]


# Model Configuration

- FVCOM 4.3.1 [@fvcom] with unstructured triangular mesh
- 10 uniform sigma (depth) layers from surface to seafloor
- Sub-500m grid resolution in many tidal energy areas
