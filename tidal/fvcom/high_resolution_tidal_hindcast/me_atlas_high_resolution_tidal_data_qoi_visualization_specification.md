## Coordinate Details

The high resolution tidal hindcast data is based on an unstructured three dimensional grid of triangular faces with variable resolution.
To visualize in two dimensions (lat/lon) the data for all depths are combined (averaging, or 95th percentile of maximums) into a single layer.
This single layer has coordinates defined at the center and corners of each triangular element.
Within the parquet files the coordinates are stored in the following columns:

Notes:

* All coordinates are in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) format.
* All centerpoints have been validated to be within the bounding box of the triangular element.
* All triangular elements coordinates are visualized below and can be assumed to be valid
* Triangular elements are not guaranteed to be equilateral or isosceles, and may have varying angles and lengths.
* Triangular elements vertice order has not been validated to be consistent across all regions.
* The Aleutian Islands, Alaska dataset has elements that cross the from -180 to 180 longitude, which may cause visual artifacts in some mapping software.

| Column Name | Description
| --- | --- |
| `lat_center` | Element Center Latitude
| `lon_center` | Element Center Longitude
| `element_corner_1_lat` | Element Triangular Vertice 1 Latitude

## Cross-Regional Comparative Analysis

Comparative visualizations across all processed regions provide insights into spatial variability, statistical patterns, and visualization parameter validation.

### Visualization Maximum Justification

These comprehensive plots validate the chosen visualization maximum (viz_max) parameters used throughout the analysis. Each visualization demonstrates that the selected cutoff values effectively capture the bulk of the data while filtering extreme outliers, ensuring meaningful and readable visualizations.

### Visualization Methodology Notes

**Visualization Maximum (Viz Max) Approach**: All visualizations use validated maximum values that capture 95-99.9% of the data while filtering extreme outliers. This approach ensures:

- Clear, readable visualizations without distortion from extreme values
- Consistent scales across regional comparisons
- Transparent documentation of data filtering decisions
- Preservation of statistical integrity for the bulk of the dataset

**Data Retention**: The following justification plots show exactly what percentage of data is retained vs. filtered, providing full transparency about the visualization choices and their impact on the analysis.
