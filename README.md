# Marine Energy Resource Characterization

This repository contains the original software used to extract and transform raw wave and tidal model output data into standardized datasets using conventions defined for marine energy applications. The project organizes data transformations by technology area (wave and tidal energy) to support marine resource characterization for different types of energy resources.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into technology-specific folders:
- `wave`: Contains scripts and resources specific to wave energy resource data standardization.
- `tidal`: Contains scripts and resources specific to tidal energy resource data standardization.

## Data Locations

### Original Data and Processing Code

The raw model output data resides on the NREL Kestrel HPC system in the directory:
```
/projects/hindcastra
```
This location includes all available datasets for wave and tidal energy models. 

### Released Data

Public data resides on the NREL Kestrel HPC system in the directory:

```
/datasets/US_wave
```
