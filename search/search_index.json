Unlike a forecast (which predicts future conditions) or direct measurements, a hindcast reconstructs past conditions by running the model over a historical time period. The results represent modeled estimates of what conditions were, not direct observations.</p> <p>Sigma Layer</p> <p>A terrain-following and free-surface-conforming vertical coordinate system used in ocean models where the water column is divided into layers that conform to both the fixed seafloor bathymetry (bottom boundary) and the time-varying sea surface (top boundary). Unlike fixed-depth coordinate systems, sigma (\u03c3) expresses vertical position as a proportion of the instantaneous total water depth, ranging from \u03c3 = 0 at the free surface to \u03c3 = \u22121 at the seafloor. This approach maintains consistent vertical resolution regardless of local water depth, with layers stretching and compressing dynamically as the water column depth varies with tidal fluctuations.</p> <p>Vertical Datum Convention: Sea surface elevation (\u03b6) is measured relative to NAVD88 and varies with time (tides, storm surge). Bathymetry depth (h) is the fixed depth of the seafloor below NAVD88. The instantaneous total water depth is D = h + \u03b6, and the physical depth below the surface for any sigma value is: depth = \u2212D \u00d7 \u03c3.</p> <p>Configuration in This Dataset: The FVCOM model uses 11 uniformly spaced sigma levels that define the horizontal boundaries of finite volume prisms. Between these levels are 10 sigma layers, representing the vertical midpoints of each prism. Model variables such as velocity components (u and v) are computed at each layer center (the centroid of the triangular prism at that sigma level). These are point values at the control volume center, not volume-integrated averages. The following tables detail the sigma coordinate values.</p> <p>FVCOM Sigma Levels (Boundaries)</p> Level Index \u03c3 Value Position 0 0.0 Sea surface 1 \u22120.1 2 \u22120.2 3 \u22120.3 4 \u22120.4 5 \u22120.5 Mid-depth 6 \u22120.6 7 \u22120.7 8 \u22120.8 9 \u22120.9 10 \u22121.0 Seafloor <p>FVCOM Sigma Layers (Volume Centers)</p> Layer Index \u03c3 Center Description 1 \u22120.05 Near-surface layer 2 \u22120.15 3 \u22120.25 4 \u22120.35 5 \u22120.45 6 \u22120.55 Mid-depth layer 7 \u22120.65 8 \u22120.75 9 \u22120.85 10 \u22120.95 Near-bottom layer <p>How Layer Depths Vary with Tides: The physical depth of each sigma layer changes as the total water column depth varies with tides. The following table illustrates this using real data from Cook Inlet, Alaska (60.74\u00b0N, 151.43\u00b0W) where the bathymetry is h = 26.7 m below NAVD88. At low tide (\u03b6 = -4.95 m, total depth D = 21.8 m) and high tide (\u03b6 = 3.82 m, total depth D = 30.6 m), the sigma layer depths shift proportionally while maintaining their relative positions.</p> <p>Sigma Layer Depths at Low and High Tide (Cook Inlet Example)</p> Layer \u03c3 Center Low Tide (m) High Tide (m) \u0394 Depth (m) 1 \u22120.05 1.1 1.5 +0.4 2 \u22120.15 3.3 4.6 +1.3 3 \u22120.25 5.4 7.6 +2.2 4 \u22120.35 7.6 10.7 +3.1 5 \u22120.45 9.8 13.7 +3.9 6 \u22120.55 12.0 16.8 +4.8 7 \u22120.65 14.2 19.9 +5.7 8 \u22120.75 16.3 22.9 +6.6 9 \u22120.85 18.5 26.0 +7.5 10 \u22120.95 20.7 29.0 +8.3 <p>Implications for Data Users: While sigma coordinates provide consistent data structure across varying bathymetry and tidal conditions, they require interpolation to extract data at fixed absolute depths. Queries such as 'average current speed at 8 m depth' require calculating which sigma layers correspond to that depth at each timestep.</p> <p>Depth-Averaged</p> <p>A value computed by averaging a quantity across all vertical layers (sigma layers) at a given horizontal location and time. Depth-averaging produces a single representative value for the entire water column, useful for characterizing overall flow conditions while accounting for vertical velocity profiles.</p> <p>Depth-Maximum</p> <p>The maximum value of a quantity across all vertical layers (sigma layers) at a given horizontal location and time. The depth-maximum captures the peak value occurring anywhere in the water column, which is relevant for structural loading calculations where components must withstand the highest forces at any depth.</p> <p>Free-Stream Velocity</p> <p>The undisturbed flow velocity that would exist in the absence of any energy extraction device. All velocity and power density values in this dataset represent free-stream (undisturbed) conditions and should not be used directly for turbine array yield estimation. Actual flow through turbine arrays will be modified by: (1) blockage effects that can reduce channel flow by 10-30% depending on the blockage ratio; (2) wake interactions where downstream turbines experience 20-40% velocity deficits in the near-wake region; and (3) device-induced turbulence that affects fatigue loading. Array yield calculations require site-specific wake modeling and cannot be derived directly from free-stream resource data.</p> <p>Unstructured Grid</p> <p>A computational mesh composed of irregularly-shaped elements (triangles in FVCOM) that can vary in size across the domain. This allows higher resolution in areas of interest (narrow channels, complex coastlines) and coarser resolution in open water, providing computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy where needed. For the duration of the model run, the horizontal coordinates (lat/lon) of grid remains fixed in space.</p> <p>Grid Structure: The FVCOM model uses an unstructured triangular mesh where each element (cell) is defined by three nodes. Model variables are computed at element centers, while the mesh geometry is defined by node positions. The flexibility of triangular elements allows the mesh to conform to complex coastlines and bathymetric features without requiring uniform grid spacing.</p> <p>Spatial Resolution: Grid resolution varies across the domain based on local requirements. In narrow channels and near coastlines where currents are strongest and bathymetry changes rapidly, triangles are smaller (higher resolution). In open water regions where conditions vary more gradually, triangles are larger (coarser resolution), reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy in areas of interest. The grid resolution variable in the dataset reports the average edge length of each triangular element.</p> <p>Model Limitations</p> <p>This dataset is derived from numerical model simulations and has inherent limitations that users should understand when applying the data.</p> <p>Physics Not Included: The model does not include wave-current interaction (waves are small in the study domains), atmospheric forcing (wind and pressure effects on tidal currents are negligible), density-driven estuarine flow (temperature and salinity effects are small), or storm surge (only astronomical tidal forcing from 12 constituents via OSU TPXO Tide Models is applied).</p> <p>Temporal Limitations: Results represent a single hindcast year and do not capture interannual variability. Tidal patterns are highly predictable, but extreme values may vary between years due to meteorological effects.</p> <p>Spatial Limitations: The model uses wetting/drying algorithms for intertidal zones; results in these areas should be interpreted with care. Model accuracy may be reduced near open ocean boundaries. Features smaller than approximately 2-3 times the local grid spacing cannot be accurately resolved.</p> <p>Known Data Gaps: Puget Sound is missing December 31, 2015. Specific files were excluded due to quality issues (see Quality Assurance section for details).</p>"},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#symbols","title":"Symbols","text":"Symbol Definition U Current speed (velocity magnitude), m/s \u016a Mean (time-averaged) current speed, m/s u Eastward velocity component, m/s (positive toward true east) v Northward velocity component, m/s (positive toward true north) P Power density (kinetic energy flux per unit area), W/m\u00b2 P\u0304 Mean (time-averaged) power density, W/m\u00b2 \u03c1 Seawater density, kg/m\u00b3 (nominal value: 1025 kg/m\u00b3) h Bathymetry depth below NAVD88, m (positive downward) \u03b6 Sea surface elevation relative to NAVD88, m (positive upward) d Water depth (total water column height), m R Grid resolution (average triangle edge length), m T Time period (hindcast duration = 1 year) t Time index i Sigma layer index (1 to N\u03c3) N\u03c3 Number of sigma layers (= 10 in this dataset) \u03c3 Sigma coordinate (terrain-following vertical coordinate) P\u2089\u2085 95th percentile operator"},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#acronyms","title":"Acronyms","text":"Acronym Definition FVCOM Finite Volume Community Ocean Model NAVD88 North American Vertical Datum of 1988 MSL Mean Sea Level IEC International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 62600-201 International standard for tidal energy resource assessment and characterization CF Conventions Climate and Forecast Conventions PNNL Pacific Northwest National Laboratory WPTO Water Power Technologies Office VAP Value-Added Product"},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#variable-documentation","title":"Variable Documentation","text":""},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#variable-quick-reference","title":"Variable Quick Reference","text":"Variable Internal Name Units Description Mean Current Speed <code>vap_water_column_mean_sea_water_speed</code> m/s Annual average of depth-averaged current speed Mean Power Density <code>vap_water_column_mean_sea_water_power_density</code> W/m\u00b2 Annual average of depth-averaged kinetic energy flux 95th Percentile Current Speed <code>vap_water_column_95th_percentile_sea_water_speed</code> m/s 95th percentile of yearly maximum current speed (all depths) Minimum Water Depth <code>vap_water_column_height_min</code> m Minimum water depth (during 1 year model run) Maximum Water Depth <code>vap_water_column_height_max</code> m Maximum water depth (during 1 year model run) Grid Resolution <code>vap_grid_resolution</code> m Average edge length of triangular model grid cells"},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#mean-current-speed","title":"Mean Current Speed","text":"<p>Internal Name: <code>vap_water_column_mean_sea_water_speed</code> Units: m/s</p> <p>Annual average of depth-averaged current speed</p>"},{"location":"tidal-hindcast/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Mean Current Speed is the annual average of the depth-averaged current velocity magnitude, representing the characteristic flow speed at each grid location under free-stream (undisturbed) conditions.
